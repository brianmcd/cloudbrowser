CloudBrowser
============
CloudBrowser is a way of rethinking how we write HTML-based Rich Internet Applications, also referred to as AJAX applications.
Put simply, the key idea behind CloudBrowser is to keep the entire application, including its data model, controller logic, and view server-side,
and use the client-side browser as a (dumb) display device,
or thin client, similar to how an X Server displays a remote X client's graphical user.
CloudBrowser instances live on a server, and client browsers can connect and disconnect at will,
and it is also possible for multiple users to connect to the same instance, which yields a natural co-browsing ability.    
See [http://cloudbrowser.cs.vt.edu/](http://cloudbrowser.cs.vt.edu/) for a detailed explanation.

External Dependencies
---------------------

* Mongodb Server.

Installation 
--------------------
1. Install [node.js](http://nodejs.org/).
2. Clone the repository to your machine. `git clone https://github.com/brianmcd/cloudbrowser.git`
3. `cd` into the cloned CloudBrowser directory.
4. Switch to the current production branch **deployment2**. `git checkout deployment2`.
5. Install all the necessary npm modules. `npm install -d`
6. Install the [mongodb](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads) server on your machine. The default configuration, which binds the mongodb server to localhost, should work. 
5. See the section on [server configuration](#server-configuration) for more details. 
6. [Optional, see below on how to try out provided examples] Create a web application using HTML/CSS/JavaScript. In the directory containing the web application, create a configuration file app\_config.json and add in
suitable configuation details. See the section on [application configuration](#web-application-configuration) for more details.

Start up
----------
you can start cloudbrowser in cluster mode by starting a master and serveral workers.
You can start master by the following script, if you omit the configPath option, it will load config file from ProjectRoot/config.
```sh
bin/run_master.sh --configPath [config directory] [application direcoties...]
```

You can start serveral worker script by the following script, you need to specify different configPath for these workers.
```sh
bin/run_worker.sh --configPath [config directory]
```

You can also try out cloudbrowser in single process mode using :

```sh
bin/single_machine_runner.sh
```

This will start a cluster with one master and two workers in a single process. 
It is like typing the following commands. 

```sh
bin/run_master.sh --configPath config examples src/server/applications&
bin/run_worker.sh --configPath config/worker1 &
bin/run_worker.sh --configPath config/worker2 &
```

Verify
-----------
Visit `domain:port/<mount point of application>` in your browser.


Configuration
-------------

###Server Configuration###
In a cloudbrowser cluster there is one master server and several worker servers. The folder config2 contains sample configurations for a cluster of one master and two workers.

#### Master Configuration
Master configuration file should be named as master\_config.json. By default, the run\_master.sh script will try to look for configuration file in ProjectRoot/config directory. You could use change that by setting configPath flag in command line.

```json
{
    "proxyConfig": {
        "httpPort": 3000
    },
    "databaseConfig": {
        "port": 27017
    },
    "rmiPort": 3040
}
```


* proxyConfig : HTTP host and port for the users
    - httpPort : Port.
    - host : If you omit this field, cloudbrowser will try to query your domain by query the DNS server.
    
* databaseConfig : configuration for data base connection
    - host : If you deploy cloudbrowser on multiple machines, do not put localhost here
    - port
* rmiPort : the port for internal communication
* workerConfig :  service settings for worker, you can overwrite the settings in this section by specify corresponding flags in command line. Please refer [Master command line options] for available fields.

#### Worker Configuration
Worker configuration should be saved in the file name server\_config.json. You should setting configPath flag to the directory contains the worker configuration file when start the worker by run\_worker.sh script.

```json
{
    "httpPort": 4000,
    "id": "worker1",
    "rmiPort": 5700,
    "masterConfig": {
        "host": "localhost",
        "rmiPort": 3040
    }
}
```

* httpPort : the port worker serves requests from the master
* id : worker's id, should be different among workers
* rmiPort : port for internal communication
* masterConfig : information of the master 
    - host : the host name or IP address where the master is deployed
    - rmiPort : master's rmiPort, should be the same as the rmiPort in master\_config.json

#### Deploy on a single machine
Please allocate different httpPort and rmiPort for each server. 

#### Master command line options

These options can be set in the JSON configuration file master\_config.json under the workerConfig object or through the command line while starting the CloudBrowser master server.

* **adminInterface**      - bool - Enable the admin interface. Defaults to false.
* **compression**         - bool - Enable protocol compression. Defaults to true.
* **compressJS**          - bool - Pass socket.io client and client engine through uglify and gzip. Defaults to false.
* **debug**               - bool - Enable debug mode. Defaults to false.
* **debugServer**         - bool - Enable the debug server. Defaults to false.
* **domain**              - str  - Domain name of server. Defaults to `os.hostname()`
* **homePage**            - bool - Enable mounting of the home page application at "/". Defaults to true.
* **knockout**            - bool - Enable server-side knockout.js bindings. Defaults to false.
* **monitorTraffic**      - bool - Monitor/log traffic to/from socket.io clients. Defaults to false.
* **noLogs**              - bool - Disable all logging to files. Defaults to true.
* **resourceProxy**       - bool - Enable the resource proxy. Defaults to true.
* **simulateLatency**     - bool | num - Simulate latency for clients in ms. Defaults to false.
* **strict**              - bool - Enable strict mode - uncaught exceptions exit the program. Defaults to false.
* **traceMem**            - bool - Trace memory usage. Defaults to false.
* **traceProtocol**       - bool - Log protocol messages to #{browserid}-rpc.log. Defaults to false.



###Web Application Configuration###
These configuration details are specific to a web application and need to be placed in the JSON file app\_config.json inside the directory
that contains the source of the corresponding application.

* **entryPoint**                - str  - The main html file of the single page web application. **Required**
* **description**               - str  - Text describing the web application.
This will be displayed on the landing page of the application (if the instantiation strategy is set to multiInstance)
and on the home page of the server (if homePage is set to true in the server configuration).
* **authenticationInterface**   - bool - Enable the authentication interface for this application.
All users must be authenticated before being granted access to any instance of it.
* **instantiationStrategy**     - str  - Valid values are:
    1. "singleAppInstance" - One application instance for all users of the application.
    2. "singleUserInstance" - One application instance per user. authenticationInterface must be set to true for this option to make sense.
    3. "multiInstance"  - Multiple application instances per user.
authenticationInterface must be set to true and the browserLimit must be set to the number of instances available to a user.
* **browserLimit**  - num - Needed only if instantiationStrategies 2 or 3 have been set to true. Corresponds to the number of applications instances
available to the user. 

A simple configuration file need only contain the entryPoint.
